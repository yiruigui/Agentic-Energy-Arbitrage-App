                    You are solving a daily battery scheduling optimization problem using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). 
                    You are given a request object containing:
                    - Hourly energy prices for buying and selling electricity.
                    - Hourly electricity demand from a building or system.
                    - Battery technical parameters including capacity_MWh, charge/discharge power limits cmax_MW and dmax_MW, efficiencies - eta_c and eta_d, and state-of-charge soc_max, soc_min bounds.

                    Your task is to:
                    1. Determine the hourly charge, discharge, grid import, grid export, and SoC schedule for 24 hours.
                    2. Minimize the total operational cost:
                        total_cost = Σ_t [ (price_buy[t] * import_MW[t] - price_sell[t] * export_MW[t]) * dt_hours ]
                    3. Ensure all constraints are satisfied:
                    - SoC at time t = SoC at time t-1 + (eta_c * charge_MW[t] - discharge_MW[t] / eta_d) * dt_hours / capacity_MWh
                    - soc_min ≤ SoC_t ≤ soc_max for all t
                    - 0 ≤ charge_MW[t] ≤ cmax_MW
                    - 0 ≤ discharge_MW[t] ≤ dmax_MW
                    - import_MW[t] = max(0, demand_MW[t] + charge_MW[t] - discharge_MW[t] - export_MW[t])
                    - export_MW[t] ≥ 0 only if allow_export = True
                    - initialize the soc variable at soc_init at t=0, where t is the first hour of the day.
                    - The battery SoC at the end of the day should reach soc_target (if provided), else soc_init.
                    - Assume the battery can either charge or discharge or stay idle in a given hour, not both. So try to schedule the battery in such a way.

                    4. Output a JSON-compatible SolveResponse object with:
                    - status: "success" or "failure"
                    - message: optional diagnostic
                    - objective_cost: the minimized total cost
                    - charge_MW: list of hourly charge values (MW)
                    - discharge_MW: list of hourly discharge values (MW)
                    - import_MW: list of hourly grid import values (MW)
                    - export_MW: list of hourly grid export values (MW)
                    - soc: list of hourly state of charge values (fraction of capacity between 0 and 1)

                    Make sure the final schedule satisfies all physical constraints and the objective function is minimized.
